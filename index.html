        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element representes the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets</li>
          <li>When possible, we should use semantic HTML elements because they make our HTML easier to read</li>
          <li>We can style HTML elements using the elements as selectors or by using the class attribute as a selector.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: 1. Inline CSS, 2. Internal CSS style sheet, and 3.external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used when we want to style an element directly in the HTML file. They're useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, for every inline must be edited individually when making changes</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>We can look for specific colors to use as HEX on the HTML Color Codes website</li>
          <li>The internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section, only apply to that page and can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code</li>
          <li>Exterbak CSS is the preferred style in most cases as it allows devs to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
          <li>When using an external style, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head. If we do not link the code, no changes will be made to the web page</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is used to control versions of code.</li>
          <li>There is a whole git workflow that includes the famous pull request</li>
          <li>To access git, we use the command line; however we always start the commands with git</li>
          <li>We can use the command git checkout to create branches</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>GitHub is the cloud where we store our code. It includes multiple tools to help us colaborate with other team members</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if else statement.</li>
          <li>If we see something which looks like a variable name but followed by parentheses it is likely a function. Functions often take arguments, bits of data they need to do their job.</li>
          <li>In JS, a value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, on,"",null,undefined,NaN or a boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true are considered truthy</li>
          <li>When creating an if statement, we provide one or more conditions for the computer to evaluate. If one condition is truthy, the computer will execute the code that we provide between curly brackets. But if the condition is not truthy the code will not execute, interrupting the control flow.</li>
          <li>Interrupting the control flow in this way allows us to build apps that respond to a user's actions.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>Strings need to be contained within quotation marks.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. They are different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JS file is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
          <li>To randomize a selection, we can use a math function that helps us select a random  number. math.floor and math.random are both properties og JS built in math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
