          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element representes the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets</li>
          <li>When possible, we should use semantic HTML elements because they make our HTML easier to read</li>
          <li>We can style HTML elements using the elements as selectors or by using the class attribute as a selector.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: 1. Inline CSS, 2. Internal CSS style sheet, and 3.external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used when we want to style an element directly in the HTML file. They're useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, for every inline must be edited individually when making changes</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>We can look for specific colors to use as HEX on the HTML Color Codes website</li>
          <li>The internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section, only apply to that page and can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code</li>
          <li>Exterbak CSS is the preferred style in most cases as it allows devs to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
          <li>When using an external style, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head. If we do not link the code, no changes will be made to the web page</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Git is used to control versions of code.</li>
          <li>There is a whole git workflow that includes the famous pull request</li>
          <li>To access git, we use the command line; however we always start the commands with git</li>
          <li>We can use the command git checkout to create branches</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>GitHub is the cloud where we store our code. It includes multiple tools to help us colaborate with other team members</li>
